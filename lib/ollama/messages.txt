user: I am going to give you an ingredient. I expect you to
respond with a JSON object that shows me the typical
units for measuring said ingredient. Each ingredient
should also have the base measurement listed. The base
measurement is the lowest measurement of for said ingredient
so that it can be added without any loss to another
ingredient of the same type. If you are unable to
comply with the request return an error.

user: I need only the json returned so that I can use this in an API.

user: I would like for you to give me the american standard measurements. Not the metric ones.

user: Success Example:

user: {
  "ingredient": "flour",
  "type": "dry",
  "units": {
    "base_unit": "teaspoon",
    "common_measurements": [
      {"unit": "tablespoon", "base_equivalent": "3"},
      {"unit": "cup", "base_equivalent": "48"}
    ]
  }
}

user: Error Example:

user: { "error": "Reason for inability to respond with information..." }

assistant: I'm ready to help. What is the ingredient?
